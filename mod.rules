Description = "Adds better prisms.\n"\
			  "Mod is based on  mod '超级棱镜 Super Prism'. But this version is much less cheaty. You still can make a 'Death Star' which would kill any thing with one shot,"\
			  "but it'll require you to build at least 100 emmitters... Also LV1-3 is quite cheap, but LV4 cost is 1.2M so it won't be soon and you won't spam them everywhere.\n\n"\
			  "Vanilla has -25% reduction for each next beam added to one prism\n"\
			  "LV1 has -10% reduction for each next beam added to one prism\n"\
			  "LV2 has -5% reduction for each next beam added to one prism\n"\
			  "LV3 has 0 (zero) reduction\n"\
			  "and LV4 +5% amplification for each next beam added to one prism\n"\
			  "+5% may seem small, but calculations show that if you manage to get 128 beams into one prism the damage would be equal to 10290 beams, so the bonus would be +7939%\n\n"\
			  "I didn't tested it with this high values. Please write comments if the limit of beams for one prism is lower - i'll try to adjust the values.\n"\
			  "If you want cheat version of this mod - use original one. There you can just focust 10-15 beams into one prism LV1 and be uber-killer."
