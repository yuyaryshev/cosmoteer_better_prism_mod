# cosmoteer_better_prism_mod

Mod is based on  mod '超级棱镜 Super Prism'. But this version is much less cheaty. You still can make a 'Death Star' which would kill any thing with one shot, but it'll require you to build at least 100+ emmitters.

Vanilla has 25% reduction for each next beam added to one prism
LV1 has 10% reduction for each next beam added to one prism
LV2 has 5% reduction for each next beam added to one prism
LV3 has 0 (zero) reduction
and LV4 +5% for each next beam added to one prism
+5% may seem small, but calculations show that if you manage to get 128 beams into one prism the damage would be equal to 10290 beams, so the bonus would be +7939%

I didn't tested it with this high values. Please write comments if the limit of beams for one prism is lower - i'll try to adjust the values.
